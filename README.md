This is a story-based game I created.

It begins with a mysterious stone crashing into an ancient city, triggering the downfall of civilization. You play as the last survivor, witnessing a dramatic transformation as aliens invade and convert the ruins into a futuristic biome.

The aliens reshape the city using plant-based energy. These plants glow with light and spread across the environment like living circuits, forming a surreal Cyber Garden City.

Your mission is to revive the city, fight against the alien forces, and restore buildings one by one. You must carefully manage vital resources like oxygen, water, and sunlight to survive.

Once the restoration is complete, you begin the final quest: finding and hacking a hidden spaceship. If successful, you escape â€” and win the game.
